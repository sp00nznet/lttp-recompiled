# A Link to the Past Recompiled

**Static recompilation of *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords* (GBA, 2002) to native Windows.**

Driving the development of [gbarecomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/gbarecomp) - the first GBA static recompilation toolkit - by throwing a much larger, more complex game at it than the toolkit's first target (Advance Wars).

## Status

| Phase | State |
|-------|-------|
| ROM loaded | Done - 8 MB, AZLE, GBAZELDA |
| Static analysis | Done - 15,264 functions, 114,908 basic blocks |
| ARM/Thumb translation | Done - 15,264 functions across 153 source files (114 MB of C) |
| Stub generation | Done - 7,331 stubs + 833 trap stubs for unresolved targets |
| Native compile | **Done** - 20.8 MB AZLE.exe (MSVC /O1, MP, ~30 min) |
| Runtime init | **Done** - SDL2 window, flat memory, BIOS HLE all online |
| Boot frames | **Done** - 300+ frames render at 60 fps |
| Game past forced blank | Not yet - DISPCNT stays at 0x0080 (forced blank) |
| Title screen | Not yet |
| Gameplay | Not yet |

```
$ ./AZLE.exe game.gba
[runtime] GBA static recomp runtime initialized
[runtime] ROM: 8388608 bytes (game.gba)
[frame 1]   DISPCNT=0x0080 mode=0 BG=0000 OBJ=0
[frame 2]   DISPCNT=0x0080 mode=0 BG=0000 OBJ=0
...
[frame 300] DISPCNT=0x0080 mode=0 BG=0000 OBJ=0
[interp] step limit hit at 0x030059B0 (2000000 steps)
```

That last line is the next thing to fix. The game copied a routine into IWRAM at 0x030059B0 (game's crt0 does this for IRQ-handling code), and gbarecomp's runtime ARM/Thumb interpreter is spinning in it for 2M instructions before bailing out — almost certainly a wait-for-IRQ-flag loop that needs a tighter recognition path or an interrupt that isn't being delivered.

## What's done

| Component | How |
|-----------|-----|
| Analysis (recursive descent CFG) | gbarecomp - 7-phase pipeline finds 15,264 functions |
| ARM/Thumb → C translation | gbarecomp - emits 153 .c files at 114 MB total |
| Stubs + unresolved trap stubs | gbarecomp - covers every referenced address |
| Standalone runtime | gbarecomp/src/runtime.c - flat memory, DMA, timers, IRQ, BIOS HLE |
| Display | gbarecomp/src/display.c - SDL2, BG mode 0/1/3/4, OBJ |
| Native compile | MSVC + vcpkg SDL2 |
| Save (SRAM) | runtime.c - .sav auto-load/save |

## What gbarecomp got from this game so far

Two fixes already pushed upstream to [sp00nznet/gbarecomp@5e8a680](https://github.com/sp00nznet/gbarecomp/commit/5e8a680):

1. **Stub generator no longer skips non-ROM call targets.** LttP's translator emitted a `BL` to `0x07EC7956` (OAM region — clearly wrong, post-undefined-instruction garbage). The stub generator's `if ((addr >> 24) != 0x08) continue` was hiding it from the unresolved-stubs pass, breaking the link with no recovery path. Now every referenced address gets a trap stub; misanalyzed calls fault loudly at runtime instead of failing silently at link time.
2. **Generated CMakeLists uses /O1 + /MP.** /O2 on the >2 MB generated translation units LttP produces (funcs_118.c is 2.5 MB, funcs_072.c is 2.4 MB) makes MSVC's regalloc burn 20+ minutes per file. Switched generated default to /O1 with parallel cl.exe. The toolkit also now copies `runtime.c` and `display.c` into the output dir alongside the headers, so the generated project builds standalone with no manual cp.

## What this project is for

Two parallel goals:

1. **Make A Link to the Past run natively on modern PCs** - no emulator underneath, just C compiled by MSVC/clang against SDL2.
2. **Push gbarecomp** - LttP exposes analysis gaps, translator bugs, missing BIOS calls, and runtime corner cases that Advance Wars never hit. Each fix lands upstream in [gbarecomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/gbarecomp).

## Build

You provide the ROM. None of the game data is in this repo.

```bash
# Build gbarecomp first
cd ../gbarecomp
cmake -B build && cmake --build build --config Release

# Translate (output is regenerated each time, do not edit by hand)
cd ../lttp
../gbarecomp/build/Release/gbarecomp.exe translate \
  "Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past & Four Swords (USA, Australia).gba" \
  -o recomp_out --multi

# Compile (gbarecomp >= 5e8a680 auto-emits CMakeLists with /O1 /MP and copies runtime.c/display.c)
cd recomp_out
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build build --config Release

# Run
./build/Release/AZLE.exe game.gba
```
